**2 convolution and max-pooling layers**

- made my data a little more accurate in comparison to only one layer
- The first Conv2d had 32 layers, so I doubled it for the second layer but kept the kernels the same
- pooling layers

**Drop out of 0.5 vs 0.2**

- 0.9689 accuracy with 0.5 drop out after final hidden layer
- 0.9736 accuracy with 0.2 dropout after final hidden layer
