## Background

As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.

In this project, you’ll use TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, you’ll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

Several such data sets exist, but for this project, we’ll use the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.

### Demo

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CiIyx_1Vi-w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiIyx_1Vi-w)

**2 convolution and max-pooling layers**

- made my data a little more accurate in comparison to only one layer
- The first Conv2d had 32 layers, so I doubled it for the second layer but kept the kernels the same
- pooling layers

**Drop out of 0.5 vs 0.2**

- 0.9689 accuracy with 0.5 drop out after final hidden layer
- 0.9736 accuracy with 0.2 dropout after final hidden layer
